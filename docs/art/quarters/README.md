# Quarters art

## Plan view

Regenerate `plan.png` and its check report from the repository root with `/Volumes/XS1000/tools/mlximg-venv/bin/python tools/art/quarters_plan.py --layout docs/art/quarters/layout.json --out docs/art/quarters/plan.png --report docs/art/quarters/plan-checks.json`. The checks cover room bounds, intersecting floor footprints, player reachability and route clearance, entrance-wall storage, and the clear doorway opening. The command exits with a nonzero status when a check fails.

## Contact sheets

Run the commands from the repository root with `/Volumes/XS1000/tools/mlximg-venv/bin/python tools/art/contact_sheet.py`. The `hero --prompts docs/art/quarters/prompts/pilot.json --prop storage_locker_module --out tmp/contact` command generates a hero for each seed in the prompt file. Add `--seeds 101` to select a specific seed. Add `--dry-run` to print the commands without generating images.

The `views --prompts docs/art/quarters/prompts/pilot.json --prop storage_locker_module --hero tmp/contact/storage_locker_module/hero-s101.png --out tmp/contact` command generates the four view edits from a hero image. Add `--seed 1` to set the edit seed. Add `--dry-run` to print the edit commands without generating images.

The `sheet --prop storage_locker_module --out tmp/contact` command composes the hero and four views into `sheet.png` and writes `sheet.json` with input hashes. It selects the first hero image by seed order.

Generated images, prompt files and provenance stay in the gitignored `tmp/` directory until a sheet is approved. After approval, copy the chosen hero, views, sheet and provenance JSON to `docs/art/quarters/sheets/<prop>/`.
